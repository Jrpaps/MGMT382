	I ordered a custom jersey for my son. I love the fabric and stiching.<br>
	It actually feels like a quality jersey that he can wear for years to come. <br>
	The name is screen printed on and the number is embroidered. There is also <br>
	extreme attention to detail and no loose stiching. I have included a picture<br>
	of what the jersey looks like on my son. He is 6'4" and wears a large. <br>
